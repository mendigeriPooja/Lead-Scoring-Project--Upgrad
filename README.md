# Lead-Scoring-Project--Upgrad
Lead Scoring Model for X Education


Overview
X Education aims to improve its lead conversion rate from 30% to 80% by identifying high-potential leads. This project develops a logistic regression model to assign lead scores (0-100) based on conversion likelihood.

Objectives

Predict lead conversion using logistic regression.
Assign lead scores for sales prioritization.
Optimize lead nurturing strategies.

Dataset & Processing

Includes ~9,000 leads with attributes like Lead Source, Website Time, Visits, and Last Activity.
Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and selects key features.

Methodology

EDA & Preprocessing – Clean and explore data.
Model Building – Train logistic regression model.
Evaluation – Use metrics like precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
Insights – Identify key factors driving conversions.

Deliverables

Jupyter Notebook – Model implementation.
Presentation (PPT) – Summary of findings.
Report – Key insights and recommendations.
